    :sc tiny_office
    :w Fade(1.25)
    The rain fell heavy on the window as I worked.
    a: I think I need a break.
    I leaned back in my chair, the monitor glowing softly in font of me.
    Suddenly I heard a knock at the door to my tiny office.
    a: Come in. The door's unlocked.
    I turned to face the wooden door as it opened, revealing a familiar face.
    b: Hi Adam, how's the script going?
    a: It's going well, I've made some great progress!
    a: I'm just taking a bit of break at the moment.
    Beth smiled cheekily. Something was up.
    b: Well if you're not busy, perhaps you'd like to meet someone?
    b: You'll like him, I'm sure!
    a: *sigh* Sure, I don't see why not.
    I got up and grabbed my jacket and headed out the door with the waiting Beth.

    >> office_reception
    Standing before me is man in a sharp suit.
    He almost looks out of place amongst the small, casually dressed team we have.
    Upon seeing me, he extends a hand which I take.
    His grasp is firm as he give my had a shake.
    c: The name's Charles!
    c: I work for Big Name Publishings and we're very interested in the work you and your team have done making visual novels.

    :m:
        c: We'd like to offer you a lucrative publishing deal for your upcoming games.
        Accept the offer:
            :j .accept
        Reject him:
            :j .reject

::.accept:
    An opportunity like this only comes around once in a life time!
    a: I'm honoured, of course we'd all be happy to!
    b: See, I told you you'd like him!
    >> success
    We accepted their deal and became a big name in the industry.
    We decided to all take a big holiday in Japan to celebrate.
    THE END
    :r

::.reject:
    This deal would just mean loss of our creative freedom that we've become known for.
    a: Thank you Charles for the offer...
    a: But we pride ourselves on our independence and creative freedom.
    a: So I'm going to have to turn you down, sorry.
    c: I completely understand, thank you for your time.
    b: Aw, I really though this would work.
    >> great_games
    Despite not having a lot of budget for our small studio, by sticking to our values we produced many fine games!
